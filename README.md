# csvToJson_with_Node
This program takes in two arguments: 
    1. input file (no file type is needed as the system assumes it's a csv)
    2. output file (no file type is needed as the system creates a json file)
To run the program, use the following command in the terminal
node csvConverter.js inputFile outputFile
The input file needs to exist in the same directory as the js file.

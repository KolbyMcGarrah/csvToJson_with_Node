# csvToJson_with_Node
This program takes in two arguments: 
    1. input file (no file type is needed as the system assumes it's a csv)
    2. output file (no file type is needed as the system creates a json file)
To run the program, use the following command in the terminal
node csvConverter.js <input file name without file type> <output file name without file type> 
The input file needs to exist in the same directory as the js file.
